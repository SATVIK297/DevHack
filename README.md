Just sign up using your VIT mail, and enjoy hassle-free cleaning, maintenance, and repairs. No more nagging or waiting endlessly for someone to show up! Plus, we’ve added key features like warden-issued notices and a mental healthcare hub, where you can access VIT counselors' details, available hours, and contact info. With HostelCare, we’ve got you covered—because you deserve to be taken care of!
